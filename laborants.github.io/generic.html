      	<h3>Why generic is the same as official?</h3>
	<p>You need to understand the difference between generic pills and official ones. The main thing is in manufacturer. The formula of drugs is the same and has not any changes. But there is many firms that can make some drugs without certificates. Everything they must do to sell their goods is to place pharmacy on the Internet. It can been done even by teenager. We should understand how is important to know the difference between good pharmacies and the other ones. They write everything they want to prove that it is true. How do you think these people will response to any complaint? Of course only when someone is going to buy something in their shop. Any other problems you will be resolving by yourself if something happens. No one helps in case of not quality drugs. That means the health might fare in danger. But what do we have more important entity than our health. That is why no one should risk the lustiness when it comes to which pharmacy we should use.</p>
	<p>We can tell all the principles on how to detect the real shop and don't get the counterfeit product, but you will need to memorize a lot of things to know hot to spot these evil firms. Why must anybody do the excess steps if just wants to buy the pills and use the treatment in such a heavy moments of his life? That is why we started this campaign of getting audience with the most expensive tools but free for you. That is how true pharmacies must work. Why should you clog your memory with some extra principles of determining bad medicines if we able to protect with all our experience.</p>
	<p>The main difference between generic medicine and original is protection against counterfeit. When one is buying pills with seals from a legal pharmacy he can be sure that everything is fine. But generic ones have none of any even primitive degrees of protection. When there is something wrong with original pack of drugs one can be completely sure that the tribunal can solve all the problems. But what to do when the medicines was bought somewhere on the Internet from the illegal address?</p>
	<p>We need remember that Generic pills are not illegal. When someone came up with idea how to treat erectile dysfunction and invented such a pill then he might make a patent. But this patent in our case has the terms. When it ends then anyone else have the right to produce pills with the same formula. Because there is not a law which forbids to use nature elements for health purpose. And this is great news for us. Because if some company wants to raise price on important drugs we still will have the choice to use identical medicine. All this text means only the one - you need to find quality on-line pharmacy before buying anything. Best way to do it is with official resources.</p>
	<hr />
	<h4>Generic pharmacy and price</h4>
	<p>It's not a secret that Generic treatment has the lowest price comparing to original resources of these methods. Is it true Generics don't mean quality? Completely not, because Generic medicine has the original ingredients without any additional conditions. It often happens when the main laboratory that produce pharmaceuticals does it with the huge volumes. A lot of tablets go to places around the world. Now try to imagine next thing, all these pills are transported without any seals. In the end of its journey they sorting between buildings. And the fact is that drugs which was transported in one truck inside same box with only one composition might be sorted with different tags just because the end point is in different locations. These are with Generic name and those ones named as crowned uniques.</p>
	<p>Anyone always has the right to choose and compare sorts of medicines they use. Generic or not is no matter if you found the right place. Because only one thing that you must always know is everybody can appears at the very hight top of your browser. It's no needed to be a specialist to make a website nowadays. No need to pay big money to get the first positions. Thus everybody has the exact right of getting the peak. Even school girl has the ability to make a blog without special knowledge. Now look how many visitors have such sites. That is happens in order to give everyone equal rights. Not matters have you erectile dysfunction or just looking for some herbal preparation. Robots aren't going to separate definitions of human mind. </p>
	<p>We must be thankful to Generic medications for their care and should be happy about today's algorithms which give us the ability to develop our dreams. Just try to imagine this world without right to be first. How it is to be a hostage of your health and corporations simultaneously? That is why it's better to learn how to treat such a small problems but still be free to choose the way.</p>
